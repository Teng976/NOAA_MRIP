# NOAA_MRIP

Hi all,

The code here is to reproduce our results for the NOAA MRIP effort callibration project. In the folder, you'll find the following code:

0_PhoneMail.R
0_Pop.R
0_Wireless.R
1_Setup_Data.R
2_Model_Design_Variance.R
3_Fit_Fay_Herriot.R
4_Predict_Mail.R

Running above code in that order should give you the result.

Thanks.
